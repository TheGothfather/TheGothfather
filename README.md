- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheGothfather
- 👀 I’m interested in advancing my Salesforce Admin/Devolper skills, as well as learning more about Javascript and testing code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Salesforce through the Trailhead and relearning basics in coding (HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, SOQL, Apex, et al). I used to code when I was much younger and I want it back!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others interested in others interested in Salesforce.
- 📫 You can reach me through here or, find my Salesforce Trailhead page: https://trailblazer.me/id/mxcarrigan2 There is also my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-xavier-carrigan/
